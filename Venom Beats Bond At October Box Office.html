            Despite 007’s return to the big screen, a venomous antihero has taken the #1 spot.
          <p>
            According to data from Box Office Mojo, “Venom Let There Be Carnage” is the top film of October 2021 with a gross of $184 million.  “No Time To Die,” Daniel Craig’s final bond movie, came in at #2 with only $124 million.  Despite these impresseive numbers, the overall results are still not that normal, compared to what their preceding franchise installments have made before the pandemic.  
          </p>  
            The first “Venom” film was released in October 2018 and made an overall gross of $190 million.  On the other hand, Craig’s fourth Bond film, 2015's “Spectre,” took in over $176 million.  Therefore, these franchises would be making similar or larger amounts of money if their current sequels were not being theatrically released during an ongoing pandemic.  With all films combined, including the Top 10, October 2021 has grossed over $553 million at the domestic box office.  October 2019 made over $781 million, which is more than a whopping $200 million difference
          <p>
            Hopefully as things get better, and as the numbers of COVID infections and hospitalizations continue to dip, things will get better for these franchises in the near future.
